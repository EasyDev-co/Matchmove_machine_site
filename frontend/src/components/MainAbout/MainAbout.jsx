            High-quality <span>filming of distortion grids</span> requires 1-3 hours of work
            by a film crew and expensive rental equipment. Grids remain in
            project archives and are not reused, or artists do not have time to
            receive them before tracking begins, and they spend a lot of time
            setting up the lens.
